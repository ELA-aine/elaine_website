          Hello! I'm a student in University of Waterloo studying Mathematics. I like programming and game design. My biggest dream is to become 
          a great game design that can express myself. Besides, I also like photography. I have taken photos for many people. Feel free to check out
           my photo gallery at Home!
        </p>

        <p>
          And also, please subscribe to my instagram, and LinkedIn if you want. :D

        <p>
          My MBTI is INFJ. Although I'm an "Introvert" person, I still like to communicate with people and make more friends. Feel Free to Connect me through LinkedIn! I'd love to
          talk to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe many people have one question: <span>Is the World we are living in right now is real or virtual.</span> Well, that's not a hard question, but it is the concept of vistual
          world and virtual reality that stimulate my interest in programming. I love how a program, a website, or a game is developed through coding. It's like building a brand new world
          with Computer! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Talking about games, I don't have much experience with playing various kinds of games. However, I watched a lot of game videos, primarily 2D RPG and Horror game. I realize that
          other than literatures, movies, game is also a wonderful platform that could express one's thought. So now, my goal is to become a <span>GAME DEVELOPER</span> that could
          possibly change the world. Yeah, I'm an Idealist.

          (ps: Still working on a game project...)
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, apart from programming, game design, I'm also drawn into the world of <span>Photography and Music.</span> I mainly do Portrait Photography, and I have done over 80 photography-related missions
          over the past two years, excluding some other events such as school-related or street photography. My camera is Nikon Z30. Music makes up another part of me. When I was young, I like playing piano, 
          and always try to improvise and self-writing a song. Now, I'm able to write several short song. Check out my music project if you want.
